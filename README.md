# spi-code

SPI is a synchronous serial communication protocol developed by Motorola used for short-distance communication, primarily in embedded systems. It enables a master device (usually a microcontroller) to communicate with one or more slave devices (like sensors, displays, SD cards, etc.).

Main SPI Lines (4 Wires): <br>
Line	Description <br>
MOSI	Master Out Slave In (data from master to slave) <br>
MISO	Master In Slave Out (data from slave to master) <br>
SCLK	Serial Clock (generated by master) <br>
SS/CS	Slave Select / Chip Select (active-low) to select the slave device
